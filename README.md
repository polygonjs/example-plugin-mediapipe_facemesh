# Demo of the Mediapipe plugin for [polygonjs](https://polygonjs.com)

The [Mediapipe plugin](https://github.com/polygonjs/plugin-mediapipe-facemesh) allows you to integrate Mediapipe into your [Polygonjs](https://polygonjs.com) scenes. It makes it much easier to add face meshes as part of a larger scene, or to add complex shaders to the captured faces.
